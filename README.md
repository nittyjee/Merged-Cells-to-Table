# Timeline to Table

This is a very useful tool that can turn a spreadsheet of merged cells into a table, and eventually vice-versa. It was made to be able to create a map from a timeline, but can be used for similar spreadsheets.

## Here's the table

Open this, and copy it.

### Instructions, Steps:

These instructions should work, but they need to be reverified. A video is also in order.

* To create a processed sheet, set any options in the "Options" tab, should be straightforward.
 
* Simply click the "Process" option in the menu, and choose either:

   "Process Current Tab" - Output, not unique

   "Process Unique Output" - Output, unique.

* If you haven't used the spreadsheet before, it will ask you if you can use your google account. Choose the correct account, and when an error pops up that says it's unsafe, choose "advanced" and choose to proceed.
 
* It will create a new tab, depending on which option you chose, that says either "Output" or "Output Unique".
 
* For some reason, could only use "Process Current Tab" for producing both. It's the only way to create "Output Unique".
 
* At some point it might say "Timed out" or "Time exceeded", which is odd, because the task is usually completed fully.


## Examples
Here's an example, using a timeline:

### With a Timeline:

Here's a timeline:
![Alt text](timeline_to_table_1.png?raw=true "Title")

Here's the result:
![Alt text](timeline_to_table_2.png?raw=true "Title")


Here's an example using money:
